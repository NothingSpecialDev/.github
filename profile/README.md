I'm Garrett, the founder of [Nothing Special](https://nothingspecial.io), and I've been building web stuff since I was 10. It became a serious hobby in 2009 and I've learned a lot about planning, building, releasing, and supporting professional-grade software with thousands of users since then. In 2016, I turned my hobby into a career, developing software solutions for the healthcare industry as a senior software engineer.

I specialize in building web apps for obscure, underpowered, not-well-documented platforms like [webOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebOS), [Firefox OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_OS), and currently [KaiOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KaiOS). The extra challenge of building for these types of platforms adds to the fun. My expertise also extends to developing desktop apps, APIs, libraries, Chrome extensions, UI component libraries, and more. I'm deeply passionate about all aspects of web development and software engineering, constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies.
