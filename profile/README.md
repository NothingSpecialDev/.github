Nothing Special specializes in building web apps for obscure, underpowered, poorly documented platforms like [webOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebOS), [Firefox OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_OS), and now [KaiOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KaiOS). Working with these kinds of platforms requires extra creativity and skill, which really adds to the fun. My expertise also extends to developing desktop apps, APIs, libraries, Chrome extensions, UI component libraries, and more. Over the last 15 years, I've learned how to plan, design, build, release, and support professional-grade software used by thousands of people.
